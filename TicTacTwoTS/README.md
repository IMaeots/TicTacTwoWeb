# TicTacTwo - TypeScript Edition

A creative twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
1 out of 7 TicTacTwos written for uni 2024-2025.

## üéÆ Game Description

TicTacTwo is an advanced version of Tic-Tac-Toe with a unique twist: the game is played on a 5√ó5 grid, but only a 3√ó3 section is active at any time. After the first few moves, players can either place new markers or move their existing ones, and even shift the active playing area!

  - Move your markers or the grid in the second phase
- **Time Tracking**: Track the duration of your games
- **Responsive Design**: Play on any device
- **TypeScript Benefits**:
  - Type safety and better code organization
  - Interfaces for clear component communication
  - Enhanced development experience with IntelliSense
