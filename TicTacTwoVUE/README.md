# TicTacTwo - Vue Edition

A creative twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented with Vue 3, TypeScript, and CSS.
1 out of 7 TicTacTwos written for uni 2024-2025.

## üéÆ Game Description

TicTacTwo is an advanced version of Tic-Tac-Toe with a unique twist: the game is played on a 5√ó5 grid, but only a 3√ó3 section is active at any time. After the first few moves, players can either place new markers or move their existing ones, and even shift the active playing area!

  - Place markers in the first phase
  - Move your markers or the grid in the second phase
- **Time Tracking**: Track the duration of your games
- **Responsive Design**: Play on any device
- **Vue.js Benefits**:
  - Component-based architecture
  - Reactive state management with Pinia
  - Vue Router for navigation between views
  - TypeScript integration for type safety
